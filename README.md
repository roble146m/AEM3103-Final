## Final Project: AEM 3103 Spring 2024

  - By: Monica Robles

## Summary of Findings
  <Show the variations studied in a table>

| Initial Variable        | Lower Value | Nominal Value | Higher Value |
|-------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Velocity (m/s)          |      2      |      3.55     |     7.5      |
| Flight Path Angle (rad) |    -0.5     |     -0.18     |     0.4      |

  Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
